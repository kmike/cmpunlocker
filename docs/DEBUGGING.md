# Debugging

Before you go asking in the Discord for help, here is a FAQ you should take a look at:

---

## "nvidia-smi: command not found"

- The installer likely didn't run or even failed. Re-run `sudo ./install.sh` and cold reboot.

---

## nvidia-smi shows 8192 or 10240 MiB (not 65536 or 40960)

- All the PLMs must show `0xffffffff`. Run `sudo dmesg | grep SEC2_DEBUG`to confirm.

- If this still persists, refer to the Discord protocol at the end of the document.

---

## PCIe still at Gen1 after install

- Verify with `sudo ./tools/watch-setup.sh verify` — it reads `LnkSta` per card. Do not trust `nvidia-smi` for this; it caches probe-time values.

- Confirm IOMMU passthrough mode is enabled. Depending on your operating system, enabling IOMMU passthrough can vary.

- Check the watcher trace: `journalctl -b 0 | grep "flip detected"` (userspace stage also logs to `/var/log/cmp-gen2-watch.log`). No flip line means the driver patch never opened the advertisement window; a flip without a resulting speed change means the retrain did not take. The full mechanism, including why late retrains fail silently, is in [gen2-window.md](gen2-window.md).

- If this still persists, refer to the Discord protocol at the end of the document.
